/**
 * Placeholder e2e test for shift creation/editing.
 * To be implemented once Detox harness is wired:
 *
 * - Launch app with TEST_DB_SEED=false so DB starts empty.
 * - Walk through email verification if required.
 * - Add a new location/geofence.
 * - Create a shift template, insert a shift on the current week, and confirm the day.
 * - Assert the Calendar header shows "Ready to submit" after confirming all days.
 *
 * Keep this file to capture intent and prevent CI from forgetting the UI-driven coverage.
