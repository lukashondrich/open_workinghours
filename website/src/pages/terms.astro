        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-900 mb-4">4. Consent to Data Aggregation</h2>
        <p>
          By using the App and submitting confirmed working hours, you consent to your data being included
          in aggregated, anonymized statistics. These statistics:
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>Contain no personal data that can identify you</li>
          <li>Are only published when groups meet minimum size thresholds (k-anonymity)</li>
          <li>May be shared publicly or with healthcare unions, professional associations, and researchers</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-3">
          You may withdraw this consent at any time by deleting your account. Upon deletion, your personal
          data will be removed, but previously calculated aggregated statistics will be retained as they
          cannot be linked back to you.
        </p>
      </section>
