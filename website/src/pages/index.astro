    <!-- Problem Statement -->
    <section class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-gray-900 mb-4">Problem</h2>
      <div class="prose text-gray-700 space-y-4">
        <p>
          Chronic overwork in healthcare carries a real human cost. Healthcare workers absorb the burden through exhaustion, long-term health consequences, and professional burnout. Patients bear increased risk through higher error rates, reduced continuity of care, and compromised safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          These costs are largely externalized:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li>They are not reflected in staffing decisions or operational planning.</li>
          <li>They are only partially captured in incident reporting or individual complaints.</li>
          <li>They rarely appear as systemic evidence in legal, regulatory, or bargaining contexts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As a result, unsafe working conditions can persist even where formal rules and protections already exist.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Analytical Perspective -->
    <section class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-gray-900 mb-4">Analysis</h2>
      <div class="prose text-gray-700 space-y-4">
        <p>
          The persistence of these conditions is not primarily a lack of rules, but a lack of usable information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working time regulations exist. Enforcement mechanisms exist. But systemic evidence of actual working patterns — aggregated, verifiable, and independent of employer reporting — is largely absent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without this evidence:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li>Individual complaints remain anecdotal and easy to dismiss.</li>
          <li>Unions and professional associations lack data for collective bargaining.</li>
          <li>Regulators cannot identify systemic patterns across institutions.</li>
          <li>Policymakers cannot assess whether existing rules are being followed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The problem is infrastructural: there is no independent, privacy-preserving mechanism for healthcare workers to document and aggregate their actual working conditions.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Solution -->

      <h2 class="text-gray-900 mb-4">Solution</h2>
      <div class="prose text-gray-700 space-y-4">
        <p>
          Open Working Hours provides this infrastructure: a mobile app for healthcare professionals to document their actual working hours, with privacy-preserving aggregation that produces systemic evidence without exposing individuals.

    <!-- Diagram: How it works -->
    <section class="mb-12">
      <DiagramPlaceholder
        label="System Overview"
        description={`IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT — Conceptual Flow Diagram (Simplified/Iconic)

STYLE:
Minimal, abstract, almost logo-like. Clean line art in a single blue tone (#3B82F6) on white background. Think: Apple keynote diagrams, Stripe's simple illustrations. Ultra-clean, no clutter. This should be understood in 3 seconds.

COMPOSITION (three simple icons in a horizontal row, connected by arrows):

1. LEFT ICON: Simple smartphone silhouette with a small clock face inside
   - Represents: Individual user logging their hours
   - NO labels, NO technical details

2. CENTER ICON: Abstract cloud or circle shape containing multiple small dots converging into one
   - Represents: Many individuals → aggregated together
   - Visual metaphor: "many become one" (convergence)

3. RIGHT ICON: Simple bar chart (3-4 bars of different heights)
   - Represents: Public statistics output
   - Clean, minimal chart symbol

ARROWS:
- Simple, elegant arrows connecting the three icons
- No labels on arrows (keep it abstract)
- Arrow style: thin, with subtle arrowhead

OPTIONAL SINGLE TAGLINE (below the diagram):
"Individual input → Collective insight"
(or no text at all — let the visual speak)

KEY CONCEPT:
This is NOT a technical architecture diagram. It's a conceptual illustration showing the IDEA:
- Many people contribute privately
- Data is combined/aggregated
- Result is public, anonymous statistics

The message is: "Your contribution matters, your privacy is protected, the output helps everyone."

VISUAL QUALITIES:
- Generous whitespace
- Perfect horizontal alignment
- Icons should feel balanced and harmonious
- Could almost be a logo or app icon set

DIMENSIONS: Wide format (16:9), but the actual content is centered and compact.

DO NOT INCLUDE:
- Technical labels (no "TLS", "k-anonymity", "encrypted")
- Server/database imagery
- Lock icons or security symbols (save those for the Privacy page)
- Multiple colors
- Complex details
- Text labels on individual elements`}
