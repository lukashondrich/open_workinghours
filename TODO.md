## Open Questions (Requires Decision)

- [ ] K_MIN value: 10 or 20? (minimum users per aggregate cell)
- [ ] Epsilon (ε) for noise: 1.0 or lower?
- [ ] Sensitivity calculation: global max or per-group empirical?
- [ ] Aggregation job frequency: hourly, daily, or on-demand?
- [ ] DPIA required? (Data Protection Impact Assessment)
- [ ] Privacy policy review timeline?

**Decision log:** Document answers in `BACKEND_REDESIGN_PLAN.md` Section 8.

## Notes

**Why the redesign?**
- Old approach: Client-side noise, anonymous submissions
- Problems: No GDPR right to erasure, cannot link to hospitals, per-user noise is inefficient
- New approach: Server-side aggregation with k-anonymity, better privacy guarantees, GDPR compliant

**Breaking change:**
- Users will need to create accounts
- Old data cannot be migrated (anonymous, already noised)
- Hard cutover deployment (no backward compatibility)

**Timeline Risk:**
- Backend work is substantial (6-8 weeks is optimistic)
- Mobile integration depends on backend completion
- E2E testing may reveal issues requiring rework

**Mitigation:**
- Start with backend Phase 1 immediately
- Test aggregation logic thoroughly with synthetic data
- Incremental deployment (backend first, mobile second)
