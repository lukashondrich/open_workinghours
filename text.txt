Yeah, Hetzner sounds good. I don't have an Apple developer account, but I'll just get one. We should plan for Android support from the start. Ask as we can, as low as we need to. Do for guidance, like what's the best place to start. Also list a number to do list that we can always fall back to. Yeah, if then we have everything complete, then the next step would be to write a blueprint and adapt the blueprint that we have. And yeah, also write true list as thoroughly.
